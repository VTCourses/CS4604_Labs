## Objective
Understanding indexing

## Lab

### Setup

* Important: This lab will create a `lab5.db` with size around 600MB, make sure you have enough disk space.

* Prepare lab5 database
  ```
  > cp ../db/labs.db lab5.db
  ```

* Connect to a database
   ```
   > sqlite3 lab5.db
   ```

* Create a table: `big_cards`
  ```
  create table big_cards as select * from cards;
  insert into big_cards select * from cards;
  insert into big_cards select * from big_cards;
  insert into big_cards select * from big_cards;
  insert into big_cards select * from big_cards;
  insert into big_cards select * from big_cards;
  insert into big_cards select * from big_cards;
  insert into big_cards select * from big_cards;
  insert into big_cards select * from big_cards;
  insert into big_cards select * from big_cards;
  insert into big_cards select * from big_cards;
  ```

A data set for the collection of cards for [Hearthstone](https://playhearthstone.com/en-us/),
the popular online card game by Blizzard. This data set is freely available from 
[Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/jeradrose/hearthstone-cards).

### Indexing

Indexes are used to retrieve data from the database very fast. The users cannot see the indexes, they are just used to speed up searches/queries.

#### EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN 

In order to see the impact of our indexing efforts, we will use the `EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN` feature of SQLite.

First: turn SQL time on
```sql
sqlite> .timer ON
```

Example:

```sql
sqlite> EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN SELECT count(*) FROM big_cards;
```

Record output below:

```
QUERY PLAN
`--SCAN TABLE big_cards
Run Time: real 0.000 user 0.000000 sys 0.000092
```

#### Using Indexes to improve performance

As a developer you know that your application will perform the query below *a lot*. It's not quite as fast as you would like it to be so you start performance tuning it.

**Query**: `select card_id, name from big_cards where race = 'TOTEM';`

You suspect an index will help, but before you make any changes you want to get a baseline explain plan and execution time. You do this using `EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN`.

**Execute**: `EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN SELECT card_id, name FROM big_cards WHERE race = 'TOTEM';`

Record output below:

```
`--SCAN TABLE big_cards
Run Time: real 0.000 user 0.000044 sys 0.000012
```

You suspect that an index on the race column will help. Let's create it.

**Execute**: `CREATE INDEX IDX1_big_cards ON big_cards(race);`

**Execute**: `EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN SELECT card_id, name FROM big_cards WHERE race = 'TOTEM';`

Record output below:

```
Run Time: real 2.082 user 1.652299 sys 0.343631
QUERY PLAN
`--SEARCH TABLE big_cards USING INDEX IDX1_big_cards (race=?)
Run Time: real 0.000 user 0.000095 sys 0.000024
```

Would it be possible to satisfy the query with an index only and further speed up the query?

**Execute**: `CREATE INDEX IDX2_big_cards ON big_cards(race, card_id, name);`

**Execute**: `EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN SELECT card_id, name FROM big_cards WHERE race = 'TOTEM';`

Record output below:

```
Run Time: real 4.313 user 3.277909 sys 0.487418
QUERY PLAN
`--SEARCH TABLE big_cards USING COVERING INDEX IDX2_big_cards (race=?)
Run Time: real 0.000 user 0.000000 sys 0.000108
```

If you issue command `VACUUM big_cards;` and re-analyze you will likely see an explain plan that *is* satisfied by the index (and consequently much faster). However, subsequent updates to the table would cause this query to go back to the table to check the visibility map.

**Execute**: `VACUUM;`

**Execute**: `EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN SELECT card_id, name FROM big_cards WHERE race = 'TOTEM';`

Record output below:

```
Run Time: real 7.037 user 2.405474 sys 3.130201
QUERY PLAN
`--SEARCH TABLE big_cards USING COVERING INDEX IDX2_big_cards (race=?)
Run Time: real 0.031 user 0.000000 sys 0.029581
```

#### The performance cost of Indexes 

In general, we don't want to create unused indexes because they incur a performance penalty. The penalty is often minimal unless the application has a very high rate of updates. But it is something to be aware of.

Let's analyze an update of every row while our two indexes exist:

**Execute**: `EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN update big_cards set race = 'FOO';`

Note the Execution time.

Record output below:

```
QUERY PLAN
`--SCAN TABLE big_cards
Run Time: real 0.000 user 0.000000 sys 0.000066
```


Now let's drop the indexes and try again:

**Execute**: `drop index idx1_big_cards;`

**Execute**: `drop index idx2_big_cards;`

**Execute**: `EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN update big_cards set race = 'BAR';`

Record output below:

```
Run Time: real 0.381 user 0.055738 sys 0.130780
Run Time: real 1.384 user 0.208304 sys 0.386505
QUERY PLAN
`--SCAN TABLE big_cards
Run Time: real 0.000 user 0.000067 sys 0.000032
```

Does the update took less time without the indexes? 
Your answer:
```
Indexes make the real time and user time lower but the system time is higher. Overall removing the indexes increases the the time.
```

Describe your findings of this Lab 5 from the recorded outputs, is everything working fine? or is anything not working? etc. Please indicate your SQLite version:

```
SQLite version: 3.26.0
Findings: From lab 5, I can see that indexing decreases the overall speed of query. Everything seems to be working fine and I have recieved no errors.


```

ps. Use this command to check your SQLite version. `sqlite3 --version`

The moral of this lab is: create the indexes you need, but *only* the indexes you need.

ps. Please remember to delete lab5.db and release disk space especially if you are using either ap1 or rlogin.

### Your turn
Now it's your turn to apply what you've learned.

1. Complete this `Lab_5.md` with your result 
2. Covert your `Lab_5.md` to a PDF file. You can use something like this: https://www.markdowntopdf.com/
3. Rename your filename to `yourPID_Lab_5.pdf` and submit it to Canvas `Lab 5 assignment`
