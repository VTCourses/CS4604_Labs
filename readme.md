# CS4604 Labs
These labs will use relational database management systems (RDBMS), e.g. [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/), [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/), [MariaDB](https://mariadb.org/), [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html) and non-relational databases e.g. MongoDB.

MySQL is an open-source relational database management system. Its name is a combination of "My", the name of co-founder Michael Widenius's daughter, and "SQL", the abbreviation for Structured Query Language.

MariaDB is a community-developed, commercially supported fork of the MySQL relational database management system, intended to remain free and open-source software under the GNU General Public License.

PostgreSQL is a free and open-source relational database management system emphasizing extensibility and SQL compliance. It was originally named POSTGRES, referring to its origins as a successor to the Ingres database developed at the University of California, Berkeley.

SQLite is an in-process library that implements a self-contained, serverless, zero-configuration, transactional SQL database engine. The code for SQLite is in the public domain and is thus free for use for any purpose, commercial or private. 

## Labs

Each individual folder has instructions for that particular lab. For example, see [0.test-setup](0.test-setup)

## SQLite
* Installation: https://www.sqlite.org/download.html
* [SQLite In 5 Minutes Or Less](https://www.sqlite.org/quickstart.html)
* [Command Line Shell For SQLite](https://sqlite.org/cli.html#:~:text=Terminate%20the%20sqlite3%20program%20by,a%20long%2Drunning%20SQL%20statement.)

## PostgreSQL on Jupter Notebooks
* Python 3 installation: [Python Tutorial](https://github.com/VTCourses/Python_tutorial)
* [Anaconda Individual Edition](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual): It is optional but strongly recommended. It would make your life easier.
* Dependencies installation: See [requirements.txt](requirements.txt)
	```
	pip3 install -r requirements.txt (Python 3)

	or 

	pip install -r requirements.txt
	```
